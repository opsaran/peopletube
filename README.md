- It can create, read, update and delete an entry
- Frontend: CSS3, Html5, Vanilla Javascript
- Backend: Node.js, Express.js, MongoDB, Mongoose

## Goal:
- To build a lightweight and basic but full stack app

## Challenges
- Frontend turned out to be a bigger challenge for me as it wasn't as easy as I assumed
- Making forntEnd for Updating entry was little tricky as I didn't have enough practice of Vanilla Javascript

## Next Steps
- Adding Tests(unit testing using Mocha)
- Adding Styles to some elements
